## Theology:

Calling -- some people have been busy and keep rushing through the first part of their life, for different reasons they 
may need to slowdown. That's a good spot for them or us to think about the calling in their life:
Dr. Philip Yeung had written a series of books about the calling, some focus in the market place. I think those books can 
be good resources to search for our calling and seek for alignment of our daily life with the callings.
